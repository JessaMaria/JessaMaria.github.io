        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p> This project aims to think about Latina/o/é Literature through markers of space and place. By mapping texts and excerpts by their location of setting it demonstrates not only the long and current presence of Latina/o/é people but the ways in which stories are also shaped and marked by place. The hope is that it can serve as a digital tool within the classroom.

        This is, in a small way, an honoring of all the many hours I spent with my advisor inside and outside of class, talking through these books and having fun. 
        </p>
